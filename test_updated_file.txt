# Updated Test File for File Upload Analysis

## Software Development Lifecycle Education

### Main Concepts:
This document covers understanding software limitations and implementation gaps.

### Key Learning Points:
1. **Placeholder Text**: Temporary content used when features aren't ready
2. **MIME Types**: File format identification system
3. **Iterative Development**: Features are added over time
4. **User Expectations**: Managing what users expect vs. what's available

### Study Questions:
- What does "not implemented yet" mean in software?
- Why might developers use placeholder text?
- How do MIME types help with file processing?
- What are the phases of software development?

### Educational Value:
This demonstrates real-world software development where not all features are available immediately, helping students understand the development process.
